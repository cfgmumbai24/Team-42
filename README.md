# Team-42

Creating a comprehensive README file is essential for guiding users or contributors through the setup and usage of your project. Here's a detailed example of a README file for a full-stack project with a frontend using Vite and a backend using Express. This README will cover the project overview, setup instructions, and basic usage.

# Full Stack Project: Vite + Express

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application using **Vite** for the frontend and **Express** for the backend. Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a fast and optimized development experience, while Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React
- **Backend**: Express, Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDb
- **Tools**: npm (Node Package Manager)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/cfgmumbai24/Team-42.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Both the frontend and backend have their own dependencies. You'll need to install them separately.

#### Backend (Express)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend (Vite)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Backend (Express)

To start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The Express server will start on the port specified in the environment variables (default is `3000`).

### Frontend (Vite)

To start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server will start on the port specified in the Vite configuration (default is `5173`).

### Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access the application at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

The backend API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

```

```

## Scripts

### Backend

- **`npm start`**: Starts the Express server.

### Frontend

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the React app for production.
- **`npm run serve`**: Serves the production build (after running `npm run build`).
